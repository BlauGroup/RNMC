    "content": "Introduction\nReaction Network Monte Carlo (RNMC) is a collection of programs for Monte Carlo simulation of statistical mechanical systems heavily inspired by SPPARKS. RNMC is designed to run large numbers of simulations of a fixed system in parallel. The project consists of three monte carlo algorithms for different domains which use ‘core’ code for shared processes, for example IO, threading logic and model independent simulation logic.\n\nThree Modules\n\n  ‘GMC’ (Gillespie Monte Carlo) : Implementation of Gillespie’s next reaction simulator. GMC is able to run simulations of reaction networks with hundreds of millions of reactions, even when the number of species is small.\n  ‘NPMC’ (Nano Particle Monte Carlo) : A three dimensional statistical field theory simulator which supports one and two site interactions. Useful for simulating nano particles.\n  ‘LGMC’ (Lattice Gillespie Monte Carlo):  Implementation of Gillespie’s next reaction simulator which couples a lattice and homogeneous region capable of electrochemical reactions.\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n  Link to another page.\n  Link to another page.\n\n",
