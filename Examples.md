# Examples
For each module of `RNMC` an simple example of its use in an appropriate application is demonstrated. This includes a description of the example, Python code for generating the necessary .sqlite files, and sample outputs. The Python code and sample outputs are inside the <a href="{{ site.github.repository_url }}"> examples directory</a>.

- `GMC` - [Homogeneous Catalysis](./GMC_exp.md): We apply the `GMC` module to simulating [cobalt-catalyzed hydroformylation](./https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2017/sc/c7sc03628k).

- `LGMC` - [CO Oxidation on Cu and SEI](./LGMC_exp.md): We apply the `LGMC` module to simulate [CO oxidation on Cu](./https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article/155/16/164701/199778/Effects-of-surface-diffusion-in-electrocatalytic) with a static lattice and a simple simple reaction network for the formation and evolution of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) in a lithium-ion battery with a dynamic lattice.
