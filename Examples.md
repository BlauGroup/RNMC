# Examples
For each module of `RNMC` an simple example of its use in an appropriate application is demonstrated. This includes a description of the example, Python code for generating the necessary .sqlite files, and sample outputs. The Python code and sample outputs are inside the <a href="{{ site.github.repository_url }}"> examples directory</a>.

- `GMC` 
    - [Homogeneous Catalysis](./GMC_exp.md): We apply the `GMC` module to simulating [cobalt-catalyzed hydroformylation](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2017/sc/c7sc03628k).
    - [Solid-electrolyte interphase](./GMC_exp.md): We apply the `GMC` module to simulate the [solid-electrolyte interphase in a lithium-ion battery](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/61c509e6f52bc461dacb7766).
    - [Energy Budget](./GMC_exp.md): We apply the `GMC` module to a system which requires an energy budget like in EUV lithography.

- `LGMC` 
    - [CO Oxidation on Cu and SEI](./LGMC_exp.md): We apply the `LGMC` module to simulate [CO oxidation on Cu](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article/155/16/164701/199778/Effects-of-surface-diffusion-in-electrocatalytic) with a static lattice.
    - [Solid-electrolyte interphase](./LGMC_exp.md): We apply the `LGMC` module to simulate the formation and evolution of the solid-electrolyte interphase in a lithium-ion battery with a dynamic lattice.
